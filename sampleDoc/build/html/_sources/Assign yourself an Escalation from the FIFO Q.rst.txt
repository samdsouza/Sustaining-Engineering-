Assign yourself an Escalation from the FIFO Q
===============================================

To assign an escalation take these actions: 

	* Assign yourslef to the CSD Ticket.
	* Change the status to "Fix in Progrss" 
	* Update Components to include Component_1 Component_2 Component_3 Component_4 so for example "Node Reboot" "mpt2sas" "SSD" this is intended as a quick (< 5 min assessment of a case and the key components) 
	* Update OS Version to include the 4 digit OS Version for Element (9.1.0.38) for example.
	* If you need to add participants to the case, enter their names in the "Request participants" field. They'll receive a notification when added. 
	* You can also create a HipChat room or choose an exisiting one from the "HipChat discussion" section. 
	* You can enter comments in the "comments" section.
	* An initial update indicating you own the case, what the next steps are and by when they are required.


HI and AIQ Escalations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	* If the escalation belongs to the HI and AIQ area, it should still be owned by CPE. The goal is to build HI and AIQ knowledge within the CPE team. Main challenges include the frequency of escalation related to these components and the effectiveness of building enough practical knowledge given that opportunities to troubleshoot these product failures may be scarce. An option could be to have a couple of people dedicated to these issues (for redundancy), and eventually rotate them.
