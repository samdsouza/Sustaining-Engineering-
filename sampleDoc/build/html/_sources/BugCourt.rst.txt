BugCourt 
============

As of May 2019 they're several bugcourt types: 
	
	* Escalation BugCourt: Support and CPE attend this escalation support. The goal is to discuss escalation in the Priority-1 and Priority-2 categories. The JIRA board: https://ngage.netapp.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=285 , shows all these cases. This baord displays data from the CSD project, so every change made to tickets in this board will result in actual changes to the CSD escalation tickets. 

	* Sustaining Bugcourt 
	* New Product Bugcourt
	* Platforms Bugcourt
