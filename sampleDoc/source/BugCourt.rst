BugCourt 
============

As of May 2019 they're several bugcourt types: 
	
	* Escalation BugCourt: Support and CPE attend this escalation support. The goal is to discuss escalation in the Priority-1 and Priority-2 categories. The JIRA dashbaord displays data from the CSD project, so every change made to tickets in this board will result in actual changes to the CSD escalation tickets. 

	* Sustaining Bugcourt 
	* New Product Bugcourt
	* Platforms Bugcourt
