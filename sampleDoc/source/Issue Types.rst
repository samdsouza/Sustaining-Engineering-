Issue Types 
=============================

Escalation Types 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When opening an escalation, there are 4 external ticket types:

.. figure:: newNew.png
   :alt: CPE escalations 

   Issue that aren't associated with DU/DL/DC

   Questions to be adressed to CPE. These tickets may not be associated to an escalation from a customer.

   Issues or requests to be addressed to an escalation manager, such as getting hardware or other resources, increasing the priority and the like.

   Issues that are associated to a DU/DL/DC case that has been resolved by Support and that no require action from CPE. THese tickets are open to track quality metrics.

   These cases will  be opened in case of emergency when a CPE DU/DL/DC has already been created but the call-out box was not checked (for whatever reason, but likely an oversight). This case contains the call-out box, a field for the callback phone number, a reference to an exisiting CSD ticket and to a SAP number, as well as the summary. 



Other
^^^^^

There are also three issue types that are internal to CPE: 

.. figure:: dPatch.png
   :alt: D-patch 

   (debug patch (aka HotFix in old SolidFire terms)): TIckets to track d-patch requests. 


.. figure:: CPETest.png 
   :alt: CPE Test 

   Tickets to request a test to be preformed by CPE. 


.. figure:: CPEDefect.png 
   :alt: CPE Defect 

   Used to log defects related to d-patches. Defects are subtasks to be created under d-patch issues.
