Triage
==========


* When a CSD ticket of the type 'CPE DU/DL/DC', 'CPE Escalation', 'CPE Management', or 'CPE Help' is created, it will have the status, 'Need Triage'. These cases will be put in the Escalations Requiring Triage queue in the CSD JIRA Service Desk:

	* **INSERT IMAGE OF ESCALATIONS REQUIRING TRIAGE ** 

* The team doing triage will then analyze the tickets and determine if they can move forward to the 'Sustaining Escalations Waiting to be Assigned' queue from where the CPE team will pull the issues to be worked on. 
* If the tickets in 'Need Triage' are incomplete and need more information (e.g. logs), the perosn doing triage will move the tickets to the 'Need More Info' status while keeping the 'assignee' field empty (i.e. unassigned). The queue 'Sustaining Escalations Waiting on Data' will display these issues.

* Once the tickets are complete, the person doing traige will move the ticket back to the 'Need Traige' status 
* Once the ticket has been triaged, the person doing triage will move the ticket to 'Sustaining Escalations Waiting to be Assigned' while leaving it unassigned
