Definitions 
==================================

Escalations 
^^^^^^^^^^^

* An Escalation is an active incident raised by Support on behalf of a customer that needs investigation by CPE. The CPE engineer owns the escalation and is responsible for communicating to Support, troubleshooting, providing support, creating a defect case if neccesary, and representing the defect in Sustaining Bugcourt until there is a target release for it. 

Defects/Bugs
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A Bug is an issue that documents a product defect and that may require product changes (code, documentation, etc). 
* CPE Support creates a Defect case and hands off to CPE Engineering after a full triage of the intial escalation. 

Enhancements 
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* If an enhancement is requested it can be handled in a couple different ways: 

    * Dev Product Enhancement 
	* This should be submitted to the appropriate JIRA project, and the appropriate Product Manager notified. 

    * Sustaining Enhancement 
	* Can be added to the CBD project in Atlassian, or the SUSTENG project after migration to nGage. 

* After an Enhancement has been filled, contact a Sustaining Manager or the appropriate Product Owner to see if any followup is neccesary.
