Scratch Usage Policy 
=========================

	* Leave the archive in place unless you know NetApp no longer needs them. 
	* Clean up after yourself 
	* If you want to ensure something is kept forever, move it away from scratch 
	* Anything older than 6 months may be removed, so be aware 
	* Anything you want to keep needs to be attached to a case
