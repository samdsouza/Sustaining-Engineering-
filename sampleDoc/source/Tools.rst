Tools 
===============================

With Current Product Engineering (CPE or Sustaining Engineering) we use a combination of tools to obtain and provide case managment, technical status and the root cause for all escalations. 

JIRA / CSD
^^^^^^^^^^

* JIRA is a product provided by Atlassian. Within JIRA we have a ServiceDesk implementation called CPE Service Desk (CSD). CSD is the definitive record of all issues currently being handled by CPE. 
* A good starting point for accessing the CSD implementation the CPE ServiceDesk in JIRA is https://jira.ngage.netapp.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=18505


VictorOps
^^^^^^^^^

* VictorOps is tied to JIRA as a notification system based on rules and schedules, it can send you emails, test, push notifications etc. 
* If you're using the app, the company "OrgSlug" is "solidfire"
