Tools 
===============================

With Current Product Engineering (CPE or Sustaining Engineering) we use a combination of tools to obtain and provide case managment, technical status and the root cause for all escalations. 

JIRA / CSD
^^^^^^^^^^

* JIRA is a product provided by Atlassian. Within JIRA we have a ServiceDesk implementation called CPE Service Desk (CSD). CSD is the definitive record of all issues currently being handled by CPE. 
* A good starting point for accessing the CSD implementation the CPE ServiceDesk in JIRA is https://jira.ngage.netapp.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=18505


VictorOps
^^^^^^^^^

* VictorOps is tied to JIRA as a notification system based on rules and schedules, it can send you emails, test, push notifications etc. 
* If you're using the app, the company "OrgSlug" is "solidfire"


Engineering On-Call Rotation 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The Engineering On-Call Rotation is a tool that allows CPE team members to determine who is on call at any given time. It can be found here, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11KVhEIXoFLx_k9Xq7uz10uXoAxS61f_ZoakOBH44DBc/edit#gid=2001285140
